I'm the main view of the application.  I draw myself on the body of the document an then I iterate through all of my Todo Items and render a MPjTodoListItemView component for each Item.

I look after events that cover items as a whole (e.g. filtering the list, clearing down completed items.)

I also look after the input field that adds new items.
